Q 1. Main differences between req.query and req.param in Express
     How are Both different from each other
     When to use then in what cases

Desc : Suppose android sends a POST request -> Intention is to send (Key,Value) to client and 
       the server should perform a database query based on the value in the server and 
       return JSON response

       or 

       Suppose a client sends say(Key,value) pair in the request ........ which one to use ?


Sol : req.query will return a JS object after the query string is parsed.

      /user?name=tom&age=55 - req.query would yield {name:"tom", age: "55"}

      and 

      req.params will return parameters in the matched route. If your route is /user/:id and 
      you make a request to /user/5 - req.params would yield {id: "5"}
